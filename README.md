üîß my project name is  studentmanagement-system
Project Title: Student Management System (Console-Based)
üìù Updated Deliverables & Mapping to Rubric
Deliverable	Description
JDK & IDE Setup	Java project initialized using JDK 17 on IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Project Structure	Separated into model, dao, ui, and util packages
Database Schema Design	Instead of SQL, use plain text or .csv file to store records
Files to Work On	students.txt or students.csv used to store student data
IO Connectivity	FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter used for file I/O
Model, DAO Classes	Student.java (Model), StudentDAO.java (CRUD using file IO)

Aesthetics/Placement	Clean console menu layout with headers, spacing, and navigation
Responsiveness/Accessibility	Validations on input, clear error messages, prompt navigation

üß† Additional Evaluation Criteria
Criteria	How It‚Äôs Handled
Core Feature Implementation	Add, View, Update, Delete students using IO
Error Handling	Try-catch blocks, input validation (e.g., email format, DOB)
Component Integration	UI menu calls DAO for data handling, DAO uses IO
Event Handling	Menu choices (input) mapped to operations
Data Validation	Email regex, name non-empty, DOB valid
Code Quality/Innovation	Modular code, reusable methods, menu loop, search feature
Project Documentation	README + inline comments in code + presentation PPT
üìä Presentation Content Update
Would you like me to update the PPT file I gave you to reflect this new IO-based version instead of JDBC/MySQL?

Also, I can provide:

A sample Java class structure using IO

Updated README content

A downloadable .txt or .csv for student storage
