🔧 my project name is  studentmanagement-system
Project Title: Student Management System (Console-Based)
📝 Updated Deliverables & Mapping to Rubric
Deliverable	Description
JDK & IDE Setup	Java project initialized using JDK 17 on IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Project Structure	Separated into model, dao, ui, and util packages
Database Schema Design	Instead of SQL, use plain text or .csv file to store records
Files to Work On	students.txt or students.csv used to store student data
IO Connectivity	FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter used for file I/O
Model, DAO Classes	Student.java (Model), StudentDAO.java (CRUD using file IO)
UI (Console-based)	Text-based menu system for user interaction
Aesthetics/Placement	Clean console menu layout with headers, spacing, and navigation
Responsiveness/Accessibility	Validations on input, clear error messages, prompt navigation

🧠 Additional Evaluation Criteria
Criteria	How It’s Handled
Core Feature Implementation	Add, View, Update, Delete students using IO
Error Handling	Try-catch blocks, input validation (e.g., email format, DOB)
Component Integration	UI menu calls DAO for data handling, DAO uses IO
Event Handling	Menu choices (input) mapped to operations
Data Validation	Email regex, name non-empty, DOB valid
Code Quality/Innovation	Modular code, reusable methods, menu loop, search feature
Project Documentation	README + inline comments in code + presentation PPT
📊 Presentation Content Update
Would you like me to update the PPT file I gave you to reflect this new IO-based version instead of JDBC/MySQL?

Also, I can provide:

A sample Java class structure using IO

Updated README content

A downloadable .txt or .csv for student storage

# Student Management System

## Project Overview

This Student Management System is a Java desktop application built using Swing. It provides an easy-to-use GUI for managing student records with features like adding, removing, searching, saving, and loading students. It emphasizes robustness through input validation and error handling.

---

## Features

- **Add Student:** Enter unique ID, Name, and Age (validated between 5 and 120).
- **Remove Student:** Remove a student by ID.
- **Search Student:** Search for a student by ID and display details.
- **Save Data:** Save the current list of students to a file (`students.dat`).
- **Load Data:** Load student data from the file.
- **Data Persistence:** Student data is serialized to maintain state between sessions.
- **Input Validation:** Checks for valid inputs and prevents invalid data entry.
- **Error Handling:** Handles file I/O and parsing errors gracefully with user notifications.

---

## Technologies Used

- Java SE 8+
- Swing GUI Framework
- Serialization for data persistence

## How to Run the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `src` folder.
3. Compile all Java files:


4. Run the main application:



---

## Usage Instructions

### Add Student
- Click **"Add Student"** button.
- Enter ID, Name, and Age (must be a number between 5 and 120).
- If inputs are valid, the student will be added and displayed.

### Remove Student
- Click **"Remove Student"** button.
- Enter the student ID to remove.
- If found, the student will be removed.

### Search Student
- Click **"Search Student"** button.
- Enter the student ID.
- The student’s details will be displayed in a popup if found.

### Save
- Click **"Save"** to save the current student list to `students.dat`.
- This file stores data between sessions.

### Load
- Click **"Load"** to load students from `students.dat`.
- Existing students will be replaced with loaded data.

---

## Input Validation & Error Handling

- Age must be an integer between 5 and 120.
- IDs and names cannot be empty.
- Search and remove operations notify if no student is found.
- File operations handle exceptions and alert the user in case of failure.

---



---

## Future Enhancements

- Prevent duplicate student IDs on adding.
- Implement update/edit student feature.
- Use a database for more robust data management.
- Enhance GUI design and user experience.
